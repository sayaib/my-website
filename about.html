    <br>


  <h5>  <p>I am an experienced Android developer, Web Developer and a longtime GNU/Linux geek interested in the newest technologies and trends.

      I have obtained a B.Tech(CSE) degree from the Brainware University in Barasat. During my studies, I have been acquiring work experience in various fields and lately I have been concentrating on software development on the Android platform.

      I have in total over three years of active Android development experience. I have worked on numerous projects used by people.
    <p>
    <p>I am eager to constantly learn new things. At the moment, my focus is on the new Java 8 and 9 language features, RxJava and RxAndroid, Kotlin, architectural patterns on Android (MVVM, MVP, etc.) and of course I am always up for trying out the
      newest Android libraries.

      For a comprehensive list of my work, please refer to my work page.

      In case you are interested in cooperation with me, do not hesitate to contact me.
